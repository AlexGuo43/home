		<h2>Hard Disk Drives</h2>
		<h2>Pros</h2>
		<!-- hard drive image -->
		<img id=hdd src="images/hddpe.jpg" alt="Hard drive">
		<p class="content">
			The first storage device is the hard drive with many pros and cons.
			The first and most important (to some people) quality of the hard drive is that it is cheap, costing way less than many other types of storage.
			This is because it is easier to create as the drive is mechanical based and there is a physical movement of the drive, also there is more production to bring the price of individual drives down.
			The next important factor of why a hard drive is good is because the base capacity.
			Even the smallest hard drives (in storage size) have a lot of storage compared to a ssd as the base storage capacity for hard drives is around 250gb as the lowest one can find on the market.
			This number can go up to a lot higher (ex: 8tb) which for the amount of storage can cost relatively cheap.
			Average cost of a 4tb hard drive is $250, when this is compared to the SSD, where an average cost of a 4tb ssd is $1000.
			As you can see this provides a lot more storage per dollar. Another reason why the hard drive is good is because it is a lot easier to find compared to many other types of storage.
			The hard drive is sold in a wide variety of technology stores (ex: canadian computers, best buy, etc.) while other options like the ssd can only be found at certain places or can be bought online.

		<h2>Cons</h2>
		<p class="content">
			On the other hand, the hard drive also has quite a bit of cons.
			The first one is the inevitable failure, although many people might think of a hard drive as robust and may last for very long, this is actually surprisingly false.
			The second the hard drives get used, the mechanical parts start moving.
			This results in the drive having a high chance of failure compared to other examples like a SSD that doesn't have any moving parts.
			Another reason why the hard drives have a higher chance of failure is because if it falls, gets a little wet, etc. it is far easier to damage compared to ex: SSDs.
			Professionals predict that the average hard drive will last around 3 years which can be a good amount of time, but if one has paid up to $400 for a drive and want to use the computer for the next 10 years, they might want to reconsider.
			The second con to a hard drive is the energy efficiency, another myth about the hard drive is that it is energy efficient when in reality it is not at all.
			A normal hard drive consumes more power than a SSD because of the mechanical parts of the drive. This is why a hard drive on a laptop is not as good as a SSD because it will reduce the battery life by a lot.
			The last con is the Size of the drive itself. This is not a big factor for many people but it can matter as some cases can only fit a certain size.
			Bigger hard drives can cause laptops to be a lot heavier than they actually are and especially as the tech industry is trying to move to slimmer and thinner, the size of the hard drive won't cut it for many of the new laptops.

		<h2>Solid State Drives</h2>
		<h2>Pros</h2>
		<!-- img on ssd -->
		<img id=ssd src="images/ssdpe.jpg" alt="SSD">
		<p class="content">
			On to the next storage device, the SSD, like the hard drive this device has many pros and cons.
			This first and most important pro of the SSD is the speed. The transfer and access speeds are off the charts compared to a typical HDD (which get even faster with newer types of SSDs like the m.2).
			Typical SSDs are around 4-5 times faster in transfer speeds than typical hard drives.
			This additional speed can be used for many uses, even just opening one’s computer, or opening chrome, one can see the massive difference between the two different types of drives.
			The second important factor of a SSD is it’s reliability, compared to other storage devices, less things go wrong.
			This is because there are no physical things to go wrong and all the data is stored as 0 and 1’s.
			The typical life expectancy of a SSD is around 10 years which is more than 3 times the life expectancy of a hard drive.
			The next advantage of using a SSD is the lower usage/heat dissipation needed to run a SSD. The SSD is a lot cooler than a typical hard drive and doesn't require as much energy.
			A big benefit to using a SSD is the noise, there is absolutely no noise from a SSD as there is no mechanical noise. This is a huge advantage for upcoming new laptops that can be used in a library.

		<h2>Cons</h2>
		<p class="content">
		There are also quite a few disadvantages to using a SSD.
		The price per GB is extremely high, but the good news is that it is slowly decreasing and it is predicted that the SSD will drop below the price of a typical hard drive sometime.
		This is because an SSD requires less actual stuff to build.
		The second con is that there are not many storage options, there are not many SSDs that offer a lot of storage having 4tb as the biggest storage size.
		Because of this, having a SSD as a backup drive is not a good idea. Some early SSD models weren’t reliable to control from a developers perspective, which can be quite bad as some programs won't work properly.

		<h2>USB Removable Drives</h2>
		<h2>Pros</h2>
		<!-- img on flash drive -->
		<img id =flashdrive src="images/usbpe.jpg" alt="USB stick">
		<p class="content">
		On to the last storage device, the USB. The first pro of the USB is how easily it reads and writes data.
		This can be useful as all the data is easily manageable, for example: if one wants to delete an old file and replace it with a new slide presentation, it can be easily done on a computer and all the information is intuitive. One of the biggest selling points of a USB is it’s portability. This is one of the biggest factors as one can carry it to wherever they want. This can be many instances but the most it's used for is to transfer data to different computers easily and efficiently.
		Although there are other portable options on the market, like the external hard drive, those are a lot heavier and bigger.
		The USB is great as it can fit in one’s pocket or on a keychain. Another advantage to the USB is it has a big storage capacity for its size as there are portable USB sticks that can store up to 1tb.
		The USB removable drive is also very durable, from personal experience, i can say for a fact that it is a lot more durable than any hard drive or SSD as i have thrown around a USB without a fear that it will break.
		Because of how it is made, even high pressure or temperature will not affect the data inside the USB.
		Plug and play is another huge feature as one does not have to worry about what happens and about petitioning the drive, one can just place the USB in a USB slot and be ready to go.
		</p>
		
		
		<h2>Cons</h2>
		<p class="content">
		As for the disadvantages, there are a few cons to the USB. The first one is how the USB is used, aka connection.
		Many users worry about the amount of times one plugs in the USB.
		we all know when we plug in a USB and it is the wrong side, many of these actions can be potentially damaging for the USB but it is also hard to avoid as it's not really clear how to plug the USB in.
		The actual connection part has also little protection and can be easily damaged, and when it is damaged, the information will have a hard time transferring.
		The USB is also known for its usage of hacking as a hacker can write a program and let it run when it connects to any port. This can be anywhere from stealing one’s data to breaking the computer entirely.
		Another minor con is the rewrite limitations as one can only rewrite on the USB stick around 100,000 times which is enough for an average user but can be a problem for users that use an USB a lot.
		The last disadvantage is the size, although this is a pro, it is also a con for a lot of people.
		Because of the size, it is easily loseable and many important/ private data can be lost when one forgets it or just drops in on the street.
